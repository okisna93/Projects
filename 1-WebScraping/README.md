# WebScraping 

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites using automated scripts. It's a powerful technique that can be used for various purposes, such as gathering data for research, monitoring prices, or scraping job listings. In this project, I've used Python to write web scraping scripts and extract data from websites.

To get started with web scraping in Python, I've used three libraries that are commonly used in the field: requests, BeautifulSoup, and yf.

The requests library is used to send HTTP requests to websites and retrieve the HTML content of their pages. It's an essential library for web scraping, as it allows us to access the data we want to extract.

The BeautifulSoup library is used to parse the HTML content of web pages and extract the relevant information. It provides a simple and intuitive way to navigate through the HTML code and extract the data we need.

Finally, the yf library is used to access financial data from Yahoo Finance. It provides an easy-to-use interface for scraping financial data, such as stock prices, market summaries, and financial statements.

Overall, web scraping can be a powerful tool for data analysis and research. By using these libraries in Python, we can easily automate the process of extracting data from websites and turn it into useful insights.
